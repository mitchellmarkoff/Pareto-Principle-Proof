Final Project Reflection
	In order to convey my argument with a visual representation I reshaped my argument on more logical, emotional and visual grounds. I was able to reshape my argument in a more logical way with the addition of videos from some of my papers sources. By doing this, my viewers are learning about the problem of student debt and tuition in America from real professionals and people who are very disguised in this field. I also changed part of my solution for this problem in hopes that a revised and more detailed approach would cause more people to adopt my personal viewpoint on the matter. I restructured my solution to one that starts with very minor and tangible changes and will evolve over years to eventually become a sufficient universal higher education system.  My revised solution is to first be educating America's youth about loans and finances in our school systems so that they can recognise how a loan will grow and how serious it is to take out loans to fund their education. After this I proposed that America revise their student loan system to one that models a country like Australia, having student loans that only grow according to inflation. By doing this the government is neither losing or making money on educating its people and cause far less accumulated student debt from interest. The final step of my solution is to have a tax increase and tuition growth cap put in place to provide free education for all Americans. 
	I used formatting and emphasis to restructure my argument to a more emotional stance. I chose to dedicate several pages of my webpage to hold individual facts which are displayed in large fonts and each accompanied by a photo. I did this to highlight how shocking and important some of these facts about student debt are. By doing this I hoped to scare my readers in a way with the severity of this problem. I wanted to prompt them to be engaged and receptive for the additional information they would be receiving as they scrolled.
	One problem that I experienced while making this webpage was choosing which information was the most important to highlight from my essay. In the end I decided that the best thing to do was to add the most shocking and attention grabbing statements, statistics, and facts and to leave behind anything that was not necessary to get my argument across. I did not want to risk boring any of my readers so I decided to only allow essential information.
I reshaped my argument on a visual level in many ways. At the bottom of my webpage I decided to add a resource page with links to loan information and calculators for anyone who feels empowered to learn more about this topic after reading my page. I chose to add photos to all of my slides so that anyone skimming through the webpage would hopefully  be drawn in or still get what my argument was about from the image conveyed on screen. I used variations of font sizes to stress different things so that larger font sizes would represent more crucial and structural parts of my argument and that smaller font sizes would be for accompanying parts to my argument.
I think that this research proposal and webpage relate to the core concept of “eloquentia perfecta” by giving us the means to display an argument that we are passionate about in all of its defined characteristics. We have a chance to showcase a passion of our own with fluency, appropriateness, and force.
